Solar-Terrestrial Data Frequently Asked Questions
How do I add Solar-Terrestrial Data to my Website?
From the main HamQSL webpage (IN ENGLISH), click the "Add Solar Data" link in the menu bar, or click on the Solar-Terrestrial banner above.A word of caution here, if you add special characters (like "/" or "\"), you will still get a banner, but it WILL NEVER UPDATE FROM THE 1ST TIME YOU USE IT!
Then just cut and paste the html that is provided in the text box next to the banner you want (color and style) into your webpage at the location you want the current Solar-Terrestrial Data to appear. A word of caution, if you resize the banners, they will look terrible (text as a gif does that!). There are no adds, so please DO NOT change the code (except position) or the free service WILL go away!.
The solar banners are available in 19 different configurations, two with VHF Openings, four with current solar images that are selectable, three World Sunlight (two flat maps and one globe), one moon globe, one solar system, and two with the last 30 days of data ploted on a line graph. Four banners are available in four background colors and corresponding text colors, and also support transparent backgrounds. The remaining 15 do not support background or transparent. Three banners (all the solar101) are available with NOAA K-Index or selectable Norway K-Index (for Europe HAMS). Two VHF banners are available with selectable MUF (from 10 locations). The six with VHF and solar images, three current world sunlit items, and two graphs do not support background or transparent. All banners have selectable 304A source data.

How do I add Solar-Terrestrial Data to my QRZ BIO page?
I created a printable pdf presentation that contains detailed instructions on adding a banner to your www.qrz.com BIO page. You can download from this link

How do I modify the banners on my web site?
You have to add command parameters at the end of the url string for the banner. For a single parameter, use the ?name=parameter command. For multiple parameters, use the ?name=parameter&name=parameter command. just keep adding &name=parameter on the end for as many parameters that are supported. Examples are given below:
To change the SoHO CELIAS/SEM 304A source data to the new SDO EVE 304A source data (available on all banners), modify the php text as follows:
If this is your only selectable choice, add "?heline=eve" to the url. For example, change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar100sc.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar100sc.php?heline=eve"
If you already use selectable choices, append "&heline=eve" to the url. For example, "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar100sc.php?bgcolor=blue" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar100sc.php?bgcolor=blue&heline=eve"
To select other than a non-transparent black background for those that indicate background and transparent, modify the php text as follows:
Choose a background color - available in black, orange, blue, or white (spelling and case important). Command is ?bgcolor=
Decide if you want the background transparent - remember you still have to choose a background color as the text is different (white text on a white background does not display). Command is ?back=transparent
Modify the php url. If you use both, you have to add a "&" to join the commands. So for example:
For a blue background non-transparent small vertical format (without index/SFI explainations), change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar100sc.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar100sc.php?bgcolor=blue"
For a orange background (black static text and red dynamic text) transparent horizontal format, change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar101sc.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar101sc.php?bgcolor=orange&back=transparent"
For a black background transparent large vertical format (with the index/SFI explainations), change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar2.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar2.php?back=transparent"
To select the desired image you want (only available on the sun image panels), modify the php text as follows:
Choose a solar image (see the table (click here)for more information about each image (2nd column, the underlined ?image= name). You have a choice of Soho or SDO images. Defaults to mdi (orange) for all except the solarsun.php, which defaults to sdo_304 (orange).
SoHo is available in vsm1 (B&W mag), vsm2 (red mag), sh (orange mag), corona (white light), c2 (LASCO white light), c3 (LASCO white light), mag (mdi mag), or mdi (mdi orange).
SDO is available in sdo_193, sdo_304, sdo_171,sdo_211, sdo_131, sdo_335, sdo_094,sdo_4500, sd0_1600, sdo_1700, sdo_comp1, sdo_comp2, or sdo_comp3
Command is ?image=
Modify the php url. So for example:
For a vertical format blue sun , change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarpic.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarpic.php?image=sdo_171"
For a horizontal format orange magnetic sun , change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar101pic.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar101pic.php?image=sh"
For a horizontal format large solar sun composite image, change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarsun.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarsun.php?image=sdo_comp1"
To change from the default NOAA K-Index to either Tromso or Dombas Norway (available on all three solar101xxx panels), modify the php text as follows:
Change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar101vhf.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar101vhf.php?kindex=tromso"
Change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar101pic.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solar101vhf.php?kindex=dombas"
To change from the default NOAA Smoothed Sunspot Number (SN) to one the NorthWest Research Associates, Inc. NWRA Effective Smoothed Sunspot Numbers either Global (SNeG) , Northern Hemisphere (SNeN)or Southern Hemisphere (SNeS) (only available on the solarn0nbh panel), modify the php text as follows:
Change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarn0nbh.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarn0nbh.php?nwra=global"
Change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarn0nbh.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarn0nbh.php?nwra=north"
Change "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarn0nbh.php" to "http://www.hamqsl.com/solarn0nbh.php?nwra=south"
To change the default solar system banner from all plannets to just the inner planets, add ?image=inner to the end of the php url (example http://www.hamqsl.com/solarsystem.php?image=inner ).
I added a randomize function for the solar image banners, that will randomly choose one of the 14 SDO solar images. Just add ?image=random to the end of the php url (example http://www.hamqsl.com/solarpich.php?image=random ). This is a pretty cool feature, but it will go away if I take to big a hit in bandwidth. You can always select your favorite image using the ?image= function. Click on the ""Solar Imgs" button at the top/bottom of the page for a complete list of available images.
For the N0NBH, Solar VHF, and Solar101 VHF banners, I changed the foF2 measurement to MUF for one of ten (10) locations as follows. Frequency provided is in MHz, and is + or - 5% (there are no correcting factors added for accuracy as in future banners). Use ?muf=xxx parameter to customize to your location. So for example to display your desired location, modify the solarvhf.php banner as follows: Defaults (no parameter given) to Boulder CO USA.
"solarvhf.php" = Boulder CO USA
"solarvhf.php?muf=athns" = Athens Greece
"solarvhf.php?muf=herm" = Hermanus South Africa
"solarvhf.php?muf=grnlnd" = Sondrestrom Greenland
"solarvhf.php?muf=alska" = King Salmon Alaska USA
"solarvhf.php?muf=niue" = Niue Island
"solarvhf.php?muf=drwn" = Darwin Australia
"solarvhf.php?muf=trms" = Tromso Norway
"solarvhf.php?muf=ant" = Mawson Antarctica
"solarvhf.php?muf=jic" = Jicamarca Peru

Whats new?
For the N0NBH, Solar VHF, Solar101 VHF, and Moon Globe banners, I added current Earth-Moon-Earth degradation (with permission). Very Poor (>5.5dB), Poor (5.4-4dB), Moderate (3.9-2.5dB), Good (2.4-1.5dB), Very Good (1.4-1dB), Excellent (<1dB).
For all banners, and the xml/rss feeds, I changed SFI from NOAA's wwv.txt file to the Latest Solar Radio Flux Report from DRAO, Penticton. You will get it sooner (NOAA has been delaying lately), and it also impacts the conditions. I am rounding the number to fit (for all you purists out there!) except for the map and globe banners. This is not selectable (yet).
I changed the timestamp to correspond to when the banner was updated (UTC).
New banner provides MUF (courtesy SPIDR at NOAA) near real-time sounding readings (in MHz) from Boulder CO USA, Athens Greece, Hermanus South Africa, Sondrestrom Greenland, King Salmon Alaska USA, Niue Island, Darwin Australia, Tromso Norway, Ascension Island, Mawson Antarctica, and Jicamarca Peru all plotted on a near real-time sunlit map. This one is great for HF propagation! There will not be a correction factor added to this banner.
New banner designed by Bob Marston (K6TR). Provides a new EVE spectral line graph of 171A, along with 304A. New is 9 MUF near real-time sounding readings (in MHz). Bob chose these areas to best represent worldwide HAM communications! Bob is working on fine tuning these MUF readings for HAM radio use, based on input from YOU. If you have a report that differs from what is displayed (updated every 15 minutes), then let Bob know. Just click this link to send actual contact reports. Bob is compiling this info, and will use everything you send to provide a correction factor - per location - that will fine tune this data to our needs.

Can I put the banner on my desktop, in a toolbar, as a Sidebar Gadget, on my Blackberry, or on my iPhone/iPad?
YES. I, and a growing number of other people have created numerous Gadgets that can be displayed in the sidebar (computer), the main page of your BlackBerry, your iPhone/iPod, your MAC, worldpress, and even Joomla.

To place on your Windows Vista Desktop (mine):
Click one of the following links to download the desired self extracting executable file
Small vertical format (without index/SFI explainations)
Large vertical format (with index/SFI explainations)
When prompted save to your hard drive
When prompted click "run", or open the Solardata.exe in My Computer
When prompted browse to your "C" drive. Note that the files need to be placed in the following path: C:\Program Files\Windows Sidebar\Gadgets in the Solardata.Gadget (small) or Solardata1.Gadget (large) folder. If you select the C Drive, the executable should place in the proper location and make the new folders. You will need administrator permissions to do this!
Close the window, and select your Gadgets
Grab the "Solar Data" icon and move to your sidebar. The Solar-Data panel should be displayed on your sidebar.
The panel reloads every hour so the 3-hour update will be displayed.
Email me with any problems you may encounter.

ON YOUR BLACKBERRY, download the following programs from http://m.jonathanhfisher.co.uk/webshortcuts/. You will get a prompt saying the application was downloaded. Click OK (not RUN) on both downloads.
Shortcut hub utility
Web shortcut 1
Open the “shortcut hub utility” from your blackberry
Enter the follow data under “Shortcut 1 Config:
Title: Solar HF/Propagation
Site: http://www.hamqsl.com/solargadget.php (for the small vertical panel) or http://www.hamqsl.com/solargadget1.php (for the large vertical panel)
Icon: http://www.hamqsl.com/bbicon.png
Press the Back key and select save
Open the generic “web shortcut 1” icon
You will most likely get a permissions window. Under “Don’t ask again for:” you need to select “file connections to….” (not the all file connections) then select “Allow this connection”
Repeat this as many times as necessary (usually 3-4) for all the files.
You will see a “download icons” progress bar, then the banner should be displayed.
Press the back arrow until your main screen is displayed and verify the new solar icon is there. Click on it to display the banner.
Highlight the “shortcut hub utility” icon and select “hide” (you don't need to see this anymore-but it has to remain on the BB).
The panel reloads every time you select it - no auto refresh.
Email me with any problems you may encounter.

Why is the data sometimes different in some of the banners?
Because I cache data and banners in order to reduce the bandwidth and processing, not only on my server, but also the servers I get my data.
Data that I get for the banners is cached every 15 minutes.
The banner image you download is also cached every 10 minutes.
This rarely impacts the 3-hour data, like Solar Flux, A/K Index, SN, etc. It will impact the more dynamic data such as X-Ray, Proton/Electron Flux, Aurora, etc.
So if you hit everything at the right moment (maybe wrong is better), the oldest the data will ever be is 30 minutes (15 + 15). Typically, it is much less than that.

Where can I find information on the data provided in the banner?
Here is an outstanding 71 slide PowerPoint briefing by Charlie Christmann (K5CEC) for understanding the impacts that SpaceWeather has on HF propagation (in layman's terms so a normal person can actually understand it).
I did find a good write-up on explaining the data in the banner in the May 09 addition of the WT4RA newsletter.
There are also a number of good places on NOAA websites. One such is the NOAA Space Weather Scales webpage.
For a one stop solution, I have created the easy to understand abbreviated table below that provides HF/VHF Propagation conditions based on the current Solar-Terrestrial Data and other sources. Factors provided include background X-Ray, Proton Flux, and K index (including the nT measurement), Solar Flux Index (SFI), Sunspots (SN), Electron Flux, and Aurora (includes Normalization factor (n) less than 2.0 = high confidence, greater than 2.0 = low confidence).
Because some items are better when high, and others low, I have color coded the blocks. Green is best contitions, yellow marginal, red unacceptable.
A printable page (best using landscape) is also provided for ease of use in the shack. This single page easy to understand table is a must for any HF/VHF operator (with a memory as bad as mine has gotten).

How are the Band Conditions Calculated?
Because the various solar conditions affect HF frequencies in different ways, calculations are provided for four HF band spectrums separately.
Calculations take into account the indices, background radiation, day/night conditions, and also take into account both propagation and noise.
While the band condition calculations are not 100% accurate all the time, they should provide a pretty good representation of the current state of the HF bands.
Raw data is also provided for the more experienced HF operators that understand the affects of each element.
Data for the VHF Conditions is from DXrobot - Gouda and Make More Miles on VHF (data used with permission).

What are the band condition ratings?
Poor, Fair, and Good.

Where does the Solar-Terrestrial Data come from?
The majority of data is from the NOAA website. There are some exceptions:
For the selectable K-Index, K is from the Norway site.
Meteor Scatter, MUF Bar, and Earth-Moon-Earth degradation is from Make More Miles on VHF (data used with permission). Very Poor (>5.5dB), Poor (5.4-4dB), Moderate (3.9-2.5dB), Good (2.4-1.5dB), Very Good (1.4-1dB), Excellent (<1dB).
Data for the VHF Conditions is from DXrobot - Gouda (data used with permission).
SFI is from DRAO, Penticton (where NOAA gets the data). I am rounding the number to fit (for all you purists out there!) except for the map and globe banners.
Solar Images are from Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO).
304A and 171A data is from SoHo and SDO.

Why is SFI different than what NOAA is reporting?
I changed SFI from NOAA's wwv.txt file to the Latest Solar Radio Flux Report from DRAO, Penticton in Jun 2011. You get it sooner (NOAA has been delaying lately), and it also impacts the conditions. I am rounding the number to fit (for all you purists out there!) except for the map and globe banners.
DRAO Penticton is the official source measurement location for SFI. They take 3 readings a day (1700, 2000 (local noon) and 2300UT), and come up with the official SFI (the last reading). NOAA uses the middle reading (2200) for their reported SFI. Normally the measurements are pretty close (within 10's), but sometimes they can be quite a bit different.

How often is the solar data updated?
It depends on the data itself, and the source data I get from the various websites.
Solar Flux, A/K Index, and SN data is updated every 3-hours.
X-Ray, Proton and Electron Flux data is updated every hour.
VHF data is updated every 1/2 hour.
Aurora, foF2/MUF,and 304A/171A is close to realtime.

How often is the solar data updated on my webpage?
When you open your page, the php script is run and acquires the latest data from the NOAA website.
Keep in mind that depending on your browser settings, the gif banner may be displayed from cache memory.
To update the solar data in the banner on your webpage with the latest NOAA data, just perform a refresh on your browser.
The Date and Time at the top of the banner is when the NOAA data was last updated.
Please do not auto-refresh any sooner than 15 minutes on your page that is displaying a solar banner. Each refresh reads the file again even though it only updates every three hours, and adds to the bandwidth problem. I have already been shut down once because of this.

Why is the banner a gif file?
GIF files are supported on all browsers, and are very small, and load very quickly.

How big is the gif file?
In most cases very small.

Is Solar-Terrestrial Data available as a XML or RSS Feed?
Yes. I recognize that a lot of you would like to create your own solar terestrial related web information. So, to make it easier, I am offering the data in XML and RSS format. Please be aware, these feeds will last as long as I do not hear grief from my ISP provider. If I do they are gone!! So please only select to update every hour - that is the update period for the flux parameters (rest are 3-hour updates). Credit to HAMQSL.com would be appreciated.

Can I change the code that I copy into my website?
Please do not change the code (except for positioning - center, left, right).
There are no advertisements, just a link back to the HamQSL website page where others can add the banner to their website.
This is a free service, and it will remain that way as long as the code remains unchanged.

A FRIENDLY WARNING
First, I want to thank the majority of all the webmasters that use this data for not removing the link in the html code. However, I am noticing a small but growing number of web pages that use this banner are removing the link back to www.hamqsl.com (yes I can see all the refering URLs on my server). I remind all of you that, unless to make arrangements with me (as a small number of sites have, the html is not to be modified to remove the link. I am trying to keep this free service free for all with no advertising or pop-ups. The link is there so others can use the data on their page - nothing more.

What if I have trouble, have a question, need help, or have recommended changes to the site?
You can contact the site administrator by email with any requests, questions or comments you may have.
