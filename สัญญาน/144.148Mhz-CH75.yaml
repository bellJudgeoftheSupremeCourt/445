Displaying Solar-Terrestrial Data Panels on your site, computer, or other personal device

Add Solar-Terrestrial Data to your Website
Solar banners are available in 19 different configurations (see below), with variations of solar indicies and measurements, HF Conditions, VHF Conditions, EME degradation, selectable and fixed MUF, selectable K index (impacts conditions), signal noise and geomagnetic conditions, current secletable solar images, world sunlight maps and globes, moon view globe, graphs and plots, and selectable current solar system planet locations.
HF Propagation predictions are just that, predictions calculated using the available data. Of course, actual conditions at your location depend on a lot of additional items. The only sure-fire way to determine if the bands are open is to fire up that HF rig and get on the air!
Data for VHF Conditions is from DXrobot - Gouda, Make More Miles on VHF, and Andy (G7IZU) (all used with permission).
Data for Solar Flare Probability is from University of Bradford (used with permission).
Data for solar data and conditions from NOAA SWPC, solar flux from Space WX Canada, MUF data from Lowell GIRO Data Center (LGDC), solar images from NASA, and world map/globes/solar system from Fourmilab (credit given).
Just cut and Paste html into your web page. You can customize most banners with selectable data, images, etc so its unique (not sure why most of you are not using this feature!) Refer to the HAMQSL FAQ Page for complete modification instructions.
REMINDER
I am starting to notice a number of sites that are not only removing the hyperlink from the banners, but also removing the credits from my data, tables, presentations, and pages. I do not mind the use of any of this information on your sites, but you must leave the credit to all people (me and the others) intact. Very respectfully 73 de Paul N0NBH.

Solar Indicies and Band Conditions on Twitter
Special thanks to Stew (M0SCU) for tweeting the current solar indicies (SFI, A & K Index, and Sunspots) and solar conditions for the HF bands on twitter at @bandconditions.

Solar-Terrestrial Data XML or RSS Feeds
I recognize that a lot of you would like to create your own solar terestrial related web information. So, to make it easier, I am offering the data in XML and RSS format. Please be aware, these feeds will last as long as I do not hear grief from my ISP provider. If I do they are gone!! So please only select to update every hour - that is the update period for the flux parameters (rest are 3-hour updates). Credit to HAMQSL.com would be appreciated.
