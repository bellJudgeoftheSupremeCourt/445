longer to help train our new team.</p> <p>As it looks now, we will need:</p> <ul> <li>a team of mods of 6 to 8 people. Moderation is done in the back-end of our Mastodon server, through a relatively usable UI. As a mod, you’ll have to agree to familiarize yourself with, live up to and adhere to our Code of Conduct; on Fosstodon and other public platforms. Workload can be divided as we see fit, handling a report is usually about a 10 minute job.</li> <li>1 to 2 technical admins for sysadmin tasks. This is mostly upkeep of our Mattermost server and implementation of our new upvote system, plus small technical tasks. Fosstodon itself is hosted at masto.host.</li> <li>a Kev to my Mike and vice versa. One person who would be interested in sharing the overall coordination. This would mean occasional chats through Signal about admin coordination and shared communication on hub.fosstodon.org.</li> </ul> <p>We’ve already received quite a few volunteering offers from our amazing community, more are always welcome! Please reply to @fosstodon’s post or send me (<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@Gina">Gina</a>) a message if you’re interested in any of the roles above. After the weekend I’ll gather everyone who has offered to volunteer onto Mattermost, and we’ll build a team.</p> <h2 id="final-note">Final note</h2> <p>I can’t make any promises, except that I will do my best. Thank you for your trust in me. &lt;3</p> </description>

<title>Fosstodon is NOT Shutting Down</title>
<description> <p>Hey folks, Kev here. 👋🏻</p> <p>You may have read the posts that Mike and I wrote yesterday about us both being burned out and wanting to step down. So I wanted to write a quick post here to set the record straight on a couple of things, as there’s some inaccurate information flying around as a result of those 2 posts.</p> <p>If you didn’t read them, here’s the links:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://mikestone.me/2025-04-28-do-what-you-love">https://mikestone.me/2025-04-28-do-what-you-love</a></li> <li><a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-fosstodon-drama">https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-fosstodon-drama</a></li> </ul> <p>I’ve not been checking in on Fosstodon regularly, since I wrote the post as it’s overwhelming, but I have seen a few posts from people saying they’re moving because Fosstodon is shutting down.</p> <p><strong>Fosstodon is NOT shutting down.</strong></p> <p>Although we’re utterly burned out, Mike and I don’t want this to be the end of Fosstodon. We would much rather hand over the batton to someone else in the community to take over and hopefully, do a better job than we did.</p> <p>We’re currently in talks with <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@Gina/">Gina</a>. She’s well liked on the instance, is very level headed and used to be a moderator, so she has a good idea of what to expect. Mike and I both trust her implicitly and think she would be a great custodian for Fosstodon 2.0.</p> <p>To be clear - there’s still a lot of conversations to be had, and a lot of stuff to hand over, but our hope is that we will hand the reigns over to Gina, if she still wants it once we’ve given her a warts-and-all run down of everything that’s involved.</p> <p>Gina has a tough task ahead of her - she will need to find new mods to bolster the existing team, and she will likely need to find at least 1 other admin to help her. If Gina decides it’s not for her, Mike and I commited to 3 months of notice before anything happens. So during that time, we will look for someone else who might be interested.</p> <p class="notice">Please don't email Mike and I offering your services. Although very kind, Mike and I have a specific shortlist of people we know and trust that we would approach.</p> <p>More to come over the next few days/weeks, but I wanted to reassure everyone that although Mike and I are moving on, it doesn’t necessarily mean the end of Fosstodon.</p> </description>

<title>Our Position On Blocking Threads</title>
<description> <p>Before we get into this, I wanted to give some context. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg decided to make some <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/">significant changes to how Meta products and services are moderated</a>, and the general consensus to these changes is that it’s all bad.</p> <p>This could mean more extremism, more abuse, and general more shittery for the fediverse as Threads now federates. With that in mind, lots of our fellow instance admins have been considering whether they should de-federate with Threads.</p> <p>Many have.</p> <p>I’ve written about <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/threads-and-the-fediverse">my personal opinions on the matter</a> before, but this isn’t about me, it’s about the 60,000 or so people that call Fosstodon home. So the rest of the team and I have been discussing the whole thing. <em>A lot</em>.</p> <p>We discussed it as a team, and after lots of discussion we were erring toward not de-federating with Threads as people have the option to personally defederate.</p> <p>But we wanted a pulse check from the community, so we decided to put a poll on Patreon that asked our patrons to give their opinion as they’re a good cross-section of our community. After 299 votes and lots of conversation in the comments, the results were in:</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/patreon-vote-results.webp" alt="Patreon vote results" /></p> <p>A lot of the discourse in the comments aligned with the discussion we had as a team in our Mattermost chat.</p> <p><strong>As a result, we have decide NOT to de-federate with Threads.</strong></p> <h2 id="why">Why?</h2> <p>This decision may piss some of you off. We get it. But when making these decision, we have to consider <em>all</em> 60k of the users on our platform. And the fact is, many would like the option of communicating with folk on Threads.</p> <p>That said, there is an option to block Threads in its entirety for your account. Had this option not been in place, we may have gone down the de-federation route, but since everyone on Fosstodon can personally block Threads, we felt it prudent to keep the doors open for those that want to step through.</p> <p>For those that don’t, you can quickly and easily slam that door shut and deadlock the shit out of it.</p> <h2 id="how-to-block-threads-on-your-account">How to block Threads on your account</h2> <p>If you’re one of the people who still want to block Threads on your account, it’s very easy to do.</p> <p>Firstly, log into your Fosstodon account on the <a href="https://fosstodon.org">web interface</a>, then go to the search bar at the top left of the page and search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@zuck@threads.net</code>. Alternatively, just click <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@zuck@threads.net">this link</a> to be taken straight to Zuck’s Threads profile on Fosstodon.</p> <p>Once there, click on the 3 dots next to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Follow</code> button, and select the option to <strong>Block domain threads.net</strong>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/block-threads.webp" alt="Block Threads on Fosstodon" /></p> <p>That’s it. All of Threads should now be blocked for your account.</p> <h2 id="will-this-change-in-the-future">Will this change in the future?</h2> <p>The short answer is <em>possibly</em>. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and if we see a lot of abuse coming from Threads to Fosstodon, we will re-think the decision and probably de-federate with them.</p> <p>At the moment though, Threads users are generally good fedi citizens. We have around 3,300 people following over 9,000 accounts on Threads and we have only received 2 reports for them. One of which was someone reporting the account just because they were on Threads. The other was because a Walking Dead meme didn’t have a content warning.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/threads-admin-status.webp" alt="Threads admin status" /></p> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2> <p>This may not be the decision that some of you want to hear, but like I said earlier, we have to think of the collective, rather than the few. Especially since you can all block Threads in a couple of seconds and be done with it.</p> <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch with us, either <a href="https://hub.fosstodon.org/contact/">via email</a>, or <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@fosstodon">on the fedi</a>.</p> </description>

<title>Introducing Supporter Tags</title>
<description> <p>As of today, we’re launching a new tag within Fosstodon that celebrates those who have chosen to financially support us. If you support us on <strong>Patreon</strong>, here’s what your profile should now look like:</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/supporter-role-example.webp" alt="Supporter role example" /></p> <p>This should effect all current and past Patreon supporters where we have been able to match your Patreon email with your registered email on Fosstodon. Whether your membership is currently active or not.</p> <h2 id="what-about-other-supporters">What about other supporters?</h2> <p>Unfortunately, we can’t add this tag for supporters who have donated by Liberapay or PayPal as there is no way for us to access your email address. <strong>If you have supported us via one of these methods, please <a href="https://hub.fosstodon.org/contact/">drop us an email</a> and we will work to get the tag added to your account.</strong></p> <p class="notice"><strong>Note:</strong> You will need to add some proof of your donation to the email <strong>and your Fosstodon username</strong>.</p> <h2 id="what-about-new-supporters">What about new supporters?</h2> <p>Now that we’ve gone through the backlog of existing supporters, we will review new supporters on a regular basis and add them. So you should see the supporter tag appear on your account within a couple days of becoming a supporter.</p> <p><a class="button" href="/support">Become a Fosstodon supporter</a></p> <p>Finally, thanks to everyone who has financially supported Fosstodon, whether that’s in the past, or at present. We wouldn’t be able to operate this beast without it.</p> </description>
