The '''Wikitech''' wiki hosts technical documentation for [[:m:Wikimedia movement|Wikimedia]]'s infrastructure and services. To edit this wiki, you need a [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Unified login|Wikimedia unified account]] (SUL) with a confirmed email address. Unlike [[:m:Complete list of Wikimedia projects|most other Wikimedia wikis]], Wikitech does not permit editing without an account.
